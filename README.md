# MHW ICE Downpatcher

A powershell-based downpatcher that downpatches MH from build 15.22 to build 15.21





## Installation

Download Downpatcher.ps1 and place inside your directory with MonsterHunterWorld.exe

Then you can run the script with powershell.

Save backups can be found in Documents/MHWSaveBackup/
## How It Works

The script installs a local copy of SteamCMD, and then requests your steam credentials in order to download the patch files.

The downloaded files are removed once the patch is complete.
